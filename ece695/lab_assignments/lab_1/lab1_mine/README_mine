Steps to BUILD the solution:
----------------------------
1. cd lab1
2. mainframer.sh 'cd os && make'
3. mainframer.sh 'cd apps && make'
4. dlxsim -x ~/ece695/lab1/os/work/os.dlx.obj -a -u ~/ece695/lab1/apps/work/userprog.dlx.obj -D k

Anything Unusual about about my solution:
-----------------------------------------
1. I have calculated Current Process ID by comparing the PCB structure elements of the "currentPCB" and the "pcbs[PROCESS_MAX_PROCS]"
2. The one that matched, I have noted the index of the "pcbs", and given it as the Current Process ID

Any external sources referenced while working of the solution:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. NONE




My Personal Notes:
------------------
1. Following is the hierarchy of the files:
   apps/userprog.c -> include/usertraps.h -> os/usertraps.s -> include/os/traps.h -> os/traps.c -> include/os/process.h -> os/process.c
